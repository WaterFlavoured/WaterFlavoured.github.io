        <h1>Gasoline</h1>
        <p>Most cars on the today road run off of gasoline. It's a really energy dense fuel (about 46 mega joules per kilogram compared to something like wood which has about 16 MJ/kg). Gasoline is a mixture of multiple chemical substances such as Heptane, Iso-octane (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane">octane</a> but with a different structure), Ethanol, etc. The different amounts of each substance determines some of the numbers you see at a gas station such as the Octane levels (87, 89, 91). Octane levels is essentially the mixture between Heptane and Iso-octane, for example 87 Octane is 87% iso-octane and 13% heptane and vice versa. Why this is important is so that your engine doesn't get excessively damaged by an effect called "knocking". Knocking in engines is where the fuel ignites itself due to the pressure it's facing from the piston (refer back to the video on the home page). This causes severe damage to the piston, cylinder walls or other mechanical parts in the engine, which would either wear down the lifespan of the engine or even cripple it. The way to combat this is through the higher octane where by increasing the percentage of iso-octane due to its structure, it is harder to compress to the point of combustion. On the topic of combustion, the reason why gasoline is so bad for the environment is the reaction it undergoes in the engine. Refering to the equation below, combustion equations almost always give out carbon dioxide, if not a complete combustion, than the poisonous carbon monoxide which are both equally bad. More details will be explained in the 'Engine' section</p>

        <h1>Diesel</h1>
        <p>Diesel was at one point considered greener than gasoline due to it releasing less CO2. This was because the ratio of diesel to air is higher than gasoline combustion in an engine as well as the higher compression of diesel allowing for higher millage out of each drop of fuel. However there's a catch, diesel releases more fine air particles due to the increase in air compared to gasoline. The thing with air is that it's not all oxygen, there's lots of nitrogen as well. This means that when air is introduced to the diesel, nitrogen will mix in with the oxygen creating NOx, which is poisonous to most living things.</p>
