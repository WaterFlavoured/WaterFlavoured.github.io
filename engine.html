        <h1>Gasoline Engines</h1>
        <p>At the heart of all engines is the process of combustion. Without it, our engines will not run. Using that principle, in a 4 stroke engine runs by having the piston go down creating a vacuum effect, sucking a mixture of fuel and air into the cylinder. The spark plug and the piston compressing the fuel will then ignite the fuel to the point of combustion which will push the piston down. The piston will then push the waste through another opening. The piston pushes the crankshaft spinning a gear which then turns the wheels of a car. Unfortunately the gasoline engine is not very efficient. 60% of the fuel is wasted essentially with 14% of the fuel completely unburned and thrown out into the exhaust pipe.</p>

        <h1>Diesel Engines</h1>
        <p>The diesel engine on the other hand is also an internal combustion engine, basically running off of the same principles of the gasoline engine. HOWEVER, the diesel engine uses something that goes against the princples of a gasoline engine, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Remember how diesel is able to be compressed more than gasoline? Well using this principle, the diesel engine can have a higher compression ratio, in simpler terms, the diesel is compressed more, therefore more combustion (going back to COLLISION THEORY, more concentration = more reaction). Even then, only have 50% efficiency in the diesel engines.</p>

        <h1>Improvements</h1>
        <p>While we can make infinite amounts of improvements to the internal combustion engine as a whole, we will never get to that 100% efficiency due to the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics stating that the entropy will increase, or in simpler terms, the surroundings will increase in heat. The principle of using combustion to power the car is very inefficient. Yes, there is a lot of energy so that the pistons can be pushed and run the car, but most of the energy turns into heat rather than mechanical energy (think of heat as useless energy). If we go down the route fo improving internal combustion engines, they can fit more turbochargers onto standard cars. They essentially use the exhaust from the engine and push a turbine which then adds a bit extra air into the engine, therefore increasing the power and efficiency of the engine. Otherwise, eventually phasing out the combustion engine is the correct move to push for a greener Earth.</p>
